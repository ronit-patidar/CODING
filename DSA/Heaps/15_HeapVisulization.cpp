/**
 * A complete binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled,
 * and all nodes are as far left as possible. This means that in a complete binary tree, all levels are fully filled
 * except for the last level, which is filled from left to right.
 *
 * Examples:
 * 
 * Example 1:
 *        1
 *       / \
 *      2   3
 *     / \  /
 *    4  5 6
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *        1
 *       / \
 *      2   3
 *     / \  / \
 *    4  5 6  7
 * 
 * Example 3:
 *        1
 *       / \
 *      2   3
 *     / \  / \
 *    4  5 6  7
 *   /
 *  8
 * 
 * In all these examples, every level is fully filled except possibly the last level, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
